To get started with Software Defined Networking here are some resources.

- [Open Networking SDN Technical Specifications for OpenFlow](https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/overview/)
- [OpenFlow and P4 Runtime](https://p4.org/p4/clarifying-the-differences-between-p4-and-openflow.html) This article is written by the creator of both OpenFlow and P4, Nick McKeown. It provides a very good historical overview of SDN and why they created P4.
